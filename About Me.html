    <p>My name is Shane and I'm a NY-based motion designer and 3D animator. Currently, I'm finishing up my degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College in Animation and Motion Graphics. I've also taken classes in 3D animation through School of Motion. At SmartCourse.io, I intern in the media department making graphics and video content for their social platforms. I also enjoy freelancing and making promotional videos, tribute videos, and more! Before animation, I recieved my masters in Speech-Language Pathology from Columbia University and was a 6th grade teacher for two years (woo!). Feel free to reach out and contact me with any questions or opportunities :) </p>
