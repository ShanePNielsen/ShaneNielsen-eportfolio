    <p>I recently completed Cinema 4D Ascent through School of Motion. I compiled a few of my projects for the course into this reel. Many of the assets were created by School of Motion, so I tried to be clear in what element of each project I focused on. Through this course, I earned a certification as intermediate in my 3D skills. </p>
    <p>Softwares utilized: C4D, Redshift, and AfterEffects.</p>
